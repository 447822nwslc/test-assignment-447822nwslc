I am keen to build my coding skills and learn JavaScript. I find the course will hwlp build my confidence in being able to understand coding better and hopefully new opportunties.
I am enjoying being a student again after a long time of no education and feel it is always good to keep yourself learning new skills and abilities.
I am wishing everyone well on their journey to becoming a code expert.
